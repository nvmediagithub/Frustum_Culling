# Implementation of the frustum culling algorithm

The frustum culling algorithm provides for checking whether an object falls into a truncated viewing frustum
and discarding those objects that do not fall into this frustum
, that is, such objects are not even
transferred to OpenGL and their vertices are not transformed by the vertex shader.
